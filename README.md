# IN-OSINT
IN-OSINT is designed to look innocent yet impactful. IN-OSINT is a more modern revamped issue of RA-OSINT. Ra OSINT was developed by William Coppola. This application was designed to make OSINT more uniform for assessors within 'Insider Agency'. 

The application was stolen by Aaron Crawford and presented as his own creation at SECKC November 18th, 2016.

After a lengthy count (civil and criminal) battle which resulted in all charges being dismissed (Presumed Innocent), I "the author and maintainer of Ra" decided that a new name and revamping was in order. 

So comes the release of IN-OSINT, pronounced Innocent, your milage may vary.
